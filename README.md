# E05b-Physics
Exploring 2D physics and collisions.

# I have edited the necessary lines of code to finish the assignment.

# In main1.py I added a gravity value of -9.8 so that the balls will drop to the bottom.

# In main2.py I added a gravity value of -9.8 as well as adding code so that the balls will bounce once they hit the bottom margin.

# In main3.py I added code so that when the sprites collide , their accerlaeration is decreased and will eventually stop in the window.
